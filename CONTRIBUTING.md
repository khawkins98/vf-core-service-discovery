## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. The convention is `[type]/[brief description]` e.g. `feature/add-templates`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation (e.g. CLI options).
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Submit that pull request!

## Report bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/oss6/vf-core-service-discovery/issues).
